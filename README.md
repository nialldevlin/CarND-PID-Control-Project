# CarND-Controls-PID
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

### The Project
I decided to use an archetecture different from the one outlined in the boilerplate code. It consists of an initialization function, a function to compute steering angle given cross track error, and a function to update the hyperparameters via twiddle. The hardest part was tuning the hyperparameters. The integration was not neccisary, but setting it to zero made twiddle not work, so I gave it a small value. I used a combination of both manual tuning to get the car generally moving in the right direction, and twiddle to fine-tune the parameters. Contrary to common sense and what was shown in the lessons, increasing D often caused even more oscillation. I noticed alot of jerky motions during steering so I averaged out the last few frames of steering angles to smoothen the steering. I also only performed twiddle every 10 frames, as the car needs time to change with the tweaked parameters to gauge progress.

  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
* [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets)
  * Run either `./install-mac.sh` or `./install-ubuntu.sh`.
  * If you install from source, checkout to commit `e94b6e1`, i.e.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets 
    cd uWebSockets
    git checkout e94b6e1
    ```
    Some function signatures have changed in v0.14.x. See [this PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/pull/3) for more details.
* Simulator. You can download these from the [project intro page](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) in the classroom.

Fellow students have put together a guide to Windows set-up for the project [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/files/Kidnapped_Vehicle_Windows_Setup.pdf) if the environment you have set up for the Sensor Fusion projects does not work for this project. There's also an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3).

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`.
